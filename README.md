# Suck n Sort🚯
<p align="justify"> Suck n Sort is a trash sorting robot which can recognize and sort organic and non-organic waste, aiming to make it easier for personnel to collect and manage waste data. Using a combination of YOLOv8 and a parallel manipulator mechanism, we were able to create a functional and high precision prototype. </p>

### Background💡
<p align="justify"> The population in Indonesia is increasing day by day, resulting in more organic and non-organic waste. Unfortunately, there is a lack of awareness among people in Indonesia about the importance of separating these types of waste, leading to confusion. To address this issue, we are developing robots that can
facilitate the separation of organic and non-organic waste. </p>
